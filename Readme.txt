📦 Assignment - Instructions for Using the Code

1️⃣ Extract the file:
- Unzip `Assignment.rar` to any folder on your computer.

2️⃣ Create a new project in NetBeans:
- Open NetBeans.
- Create a new Java project (you can use Java with Ant or Maven).
- Name it however you like.

3️⃣ Add the package to the project:
- Open the folder of the project you just created.
- Go to the `src` directory.
- Copy the unzipped package folder into the `src` directory.

📌 Note:
- You may need to **rename the package** to match your project’s package naming convention (e.g., `com.yourname.projectname`).
- After renaming the folder, open the `.java` files and update the package declaration at the top:
  ```java
  package currentpackagename;
